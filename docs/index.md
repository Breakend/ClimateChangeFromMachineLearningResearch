### Requests for contributions

+ Live and more accurate carbon emissions readouts for regions. ElectricityMap provides paid API, but can likely replicate something similar to crawl live emissions. This would take into account differences in Carbon Emissions from running during the daytime where solar is available vs. running overnight where it is unavailable. 
+ More regions with carbon emissions profiles
+ AMD Processors
+ Better way to get fine-grained Intel RAPL readings
+ RAPL support on Mac
+ Better/more accurate NVIDIA readouts
+ Ways to handle operation counts at hardware level for consistency
+ Account for disk/network usage in power metering
